        "Hello! I am Hannah Kim, a graduate student at Georgetown University majoring in Masters of Science of Data Science and Analytics. I completed my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering with experiences in Java and C, and now pursuing to become a data scientist, analyst who can convey meaningful results to the audience. After graduating my undergrad, I worked at Medtronic Korea as a Technical User Support Analyst and not only did I gain technical skills in hardware field, but I also improved communication skills by meeting new people. After working for a year, I successfully made it to the United States in 2023! I am soon graduating from my master’s degree and I am looking for an exciting and professional challenge and am keen to continue my career. Outside of school, I love to go out and enjoy playing with my cats. I have two cats in my hometown: Pepper, Button, and kept Cabbage for approximately two months. Checkout my cats and see how cute they are!\n",
