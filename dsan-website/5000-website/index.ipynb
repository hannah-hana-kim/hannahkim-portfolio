        "Hello! I am Hannah Kim, a graduate student at Georgetown University majoring in Masters of Science of Data Science and Analytics. I completed my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering with some experiences in C and Java, and now pursuing to become a data anlayst who can convey meaningful results to the audience. After graduating my undergrad, I worked at Medtronic Korea as a Technical User Support Analyst for a year and not only did I gain technical skills in Hardware field, but I also gained communication skills by meeting new people. After working for a year, I successfully made it to the United States in 2023! I am excited for my two-year journey in this program, and looking forward to meet and communicate with new people. Outside of school, I love coffee and love to go out, so I often go to coffee shops and stay there for a whole day. I have a twin sister living in Ottawa, Canada and she is my best friend in the world. Also, I am a huge animal lover, especially cats. I have two cats in my hometown: Pepper, Button, and kept Cabbage for approximately two months. Checkout my cats and see how cute they are!\n",
